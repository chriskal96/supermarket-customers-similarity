# Supermarket Customers Similarity

This repository includes an assignment assigned for the cource "Mining Big Datasets" offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics of the Athens University of Economics and Business. In this assignment i will implement a simple workflow that will assess the similarity between supermarket customers. The workflow will be used to compute, and suggest
for any input customer, a list of his/her 10 most similar other customers. Moreover, i will be using these results to predict the rating of a customer. 

The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/chriskal96/supermarket-customers-similarity/blob/main/groceries.csv)
